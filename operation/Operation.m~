        %names of operations that this operation object will receive data
        %from, and what it will receive from them.  Stored in the format:

        %insertion_type controls where this operation should be inserted in
        %a queue.  Currently, there are no guarantees as to a specific
        %index at which an operation will be placed.  This is intended as
        %an enumeration, where the possible values are {start, end}

    methods
        %METHOD: stop_on
        %Used to configure the operation's stop condition in the queue, which in turn determines whether the operation
        %should remain in the queue after it executes.
        %Should the operation only execute once?  If so, it has
        %a single_shot stop type
        %Should it execute a certain number of times? If so, it has a repeat
        %stop type, and the stop trigger specified should be some number of
        %times for the operation to execute
        %Should it stop on some other conditional? If so, it has a trigger
        %stop type, and you must provide the handle of the function to call
        %that the queue will evaluate each time after the operation executes
        %Params: obj
        %condition_type: {'repeat', 'trigger', 'single_shot'}.  Configures
        %how the container queue of this operation should assess whether it
        %should remain in the queue for another execution, or remove it
        %stop_trigger: can either be not passed, a number, or a function
        %handle depending on the condition_type

        end
        
        %METHOD: execute
        %The most important method of the operational design model
        %implemented for this GUI.  This method specifies what operation
        %the operation object will perform when called in a given queue.
        %This could be displaying an image, retrieving data from a sensor,
        %or logging a value, but the execute method code must be consistent
        %for a given operation type.  Whether it takes argument(s) does not
        %have to be consistent for any given operation.
