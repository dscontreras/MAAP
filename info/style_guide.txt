STYLE GUIDE:

Functions:
Function names will be formatted the following way: function_name().  That is, there will be underscores separating words
and no capital letters. Function contents will be indented by tabs, and all loops and conditionals will be further indented.

Variable Names:
Variable names will feature underscore separations and no capital letters.

Class Names:
Class names will be formatted with camel-case.

These formatting guidelines must be followed in order to create clean code.
